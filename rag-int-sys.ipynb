На отрезке [0, 1] ⊂R изобразите множество чисел x ∈[0, 1], троичная запись\nкоторых x =0,α1α2α3… , где αi ∈{0, 1, 2}, обладает свойством:\na) α1 ̸=1;\nb) (α1 ̸=1)∧(α2 ̸=1);\nc) ∀i ∈N (αi ̸=1) (канторово множество).\n. (Продолжение задачи 7.) Покажите, что\na) множество тех чисел x ∈[0, 1], троичная запись которых не содержит 1, равно-\nмощно множеству всех чисел, двоичное представление которых имеет вид 0,β1β2… ;\nb) канторово множество равномощно множеству всех точек отрезка [0, 1].\nГлава III\nПредел\nОбсуждая различные стороны понятия действительного числа, мы,\nв частности, отметили, что при измерении реальных физических величин\nполучаются последовательности их приближенных значений, с которыми\nзатем и приходится работать.\nТакое положение дел немедленно вызывает по крайней мере три следую-\nщих вопроса:\n1) Какое отношение имеет полученная последовательность приближе-\nний к измеряемой величине? Мы имеем в виду математическую сторону\nдела, т. е. мы хотим получить точную запись того, что вообще означает\nвыражение «последовательность приближенных значений» и в какой мере\nтакая последовательность описывает значение величины; однозначно ли\nэто описание или одна и та же последовательность может отвечать разным\nзначениям измеряемой величины.\n2) Как связаны операции над приближенными значениями величин с те-\nми же операциями над их точными значениями и чем характеризуются те\nоперации, при выполнении которых допустима подмена точных значений\nвеличин приближенными?\n3) Как по самой последовательности чисел определить, может ли она\n\nимеет предела, то ряд называют расходящимся.\nОïðåäåëåíèå 20. Предел\nlim\nn→Ì sn = s последовательности частичных\nсумм, если он существует, называется суммой ряда.\nИменно в этом смысле мы и будем в дальнейшем понимать запись\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan = s.\nПоскольку сходимость ряда равносильна сходимости последовательности\nего частичных сумм {sn}, то применением к {sn} критерия Коши сразу полу-\nчается\nТåîðåìà 6 (критерий Коши сходимости ряда). Ряд a1 + … + an + … схо-\nдится тогда и только тогда, когда для любого ϵ > 0 найдется такое число\nN ∈N, что из m⩾n> N следует |an +…+am|<ϵ.\nСëåäñòâèå 1. Если в ряде изменить только конечное число членов, то\nполучающийся при этом новый ряд будет сходиться, если сходился исходный\nряд, и будет расходиться, если исходный ряд расходился.\n◀Для доказательства достаточно в критерии Коши считать число N превы-\nшающим максимальный из номеров измененных членов ряда. ▶\nСëåäñòâèå 2. Для того чтобы ряд a1 +…+an +… сходился, необходимо,\nчтобы его члены стремились к нулю при n→Ì, т. е. необходимо lim\nn→Ì an =0.\n◀Достаточно положить в критерии m = n и воспользоваться определением\nпредела последовательности. ▶\nВот другое доказательство: an = sn −sn−1 и, коль скоро lim\nn→Ì sn = s, имеем\nlim\nn→Ì an = lim\nn→Ì(sn −sn−1)= lim\nn→Ì sn −lim\nn→Ì sn−1 = s−s=0.\nПðèìåð 20. Ряд 1 + q + q2 + … + qn + … часто называют суммой беско-\nнечной геометрической прогрессии. Исследуем его сходимость.\nПоскольку |qn| = |q|n, то при |q| ⩾1 будет |qn| ⩾1 и в этом случае не вы-\nполнен необходимый признак сходимости ряда.\nПусть теперь |q|<1. Тогда\nsn = 1+q +…+qn−1 = 1−qn\n1−q\nи lim\nn→Ì sn =\n1\n1−q, поскольку lim\nn→Ì qn =0, если |q|<1.\n1Таким образом, на самом деле под рядом мы подразумеваем упорядоченную пару\n({an}, {sn}) последовательностей, связанных соотношением ∀n∈N (sn =\nnP\nk=1\nak).\n§ . ïðåäåë ïîñëåäîâàòåëüíîñòè\n89\nТаким образом, ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nqn−1 сходится тогда и только тогда, когда |q|<1 и\nв этом случае его сумма равна\n1\n1−q.\nПðèìåð 21. Ряд 1 + 1\n2 + … + 1\n\nбудем иметь |an| < qn и, поскольку ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nqn при |q| < 1 сходится, ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan\n(по теореме сравнения или признаку Вейерштрасса) сходится абсолютно.\nb) Поскольку α является частичным пределом последовательности {an}\n(см. утверждение 1), то найдется подпоследовательность {ank} такая, что\nlim\nk→Ì\nnkpank = α. Если α > 1, то найдется номер K ∈N такой, что при любом\nk > K будет |ank| > 1, тем самым необходимое условие сходимости (an →0)\nдля ряда\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan не выполнено и он расходится.\nc) Мы уже знаем, что ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\n1\nn расходится, а ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\n1\nn2 сходится (абсо-\nлютно, так как\n\f\f\f 1\nn2\n\f\f\f= 1\nn2 ). Вместе с тем lim\nn→Ì\nnr\n1\nn = lim\nn→Ì\n1\nnpn =1 и\nlim\nn→Ì\nnr\n1\nn2 = lim\nn→Ì\nnr\n1\nn2 = lim\nn→Ì\n\u0010 1\nnpn\n\u00112\n= 1. ▶\nПðèìåð 27. Исследуем, при каких значениях x ∈R ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\n(2+(−1)n)nxn\nсходится.\nПодсчитаем α = lim\nn→Ì\nnp\n|(2+(−1)n)nxn| = |x| lim\nn→Ì |2 + (−1)n| = 3|x|. Таким\nобразом, при |x| < 1\n3 ряд сходится и даже абсолютно, а при |x| > 1\n3 ряд\nрасходится. Случай |x| = 1\n3 требует специального рассмотрения. В нашем\nпримере оно элементарно, ибо при |x| = 1\n3 для четных значений n имеем\n(2 + (−1)2k)x2k = 32k 1\n3\n2k\n= 1 и ряд расходится, поскольку для него не\nвыполнено необходимое условие сходимости.\n§ . ïðåäåë ïîñëåäîâàòåëüíîñòè\n93\nСëåäñòâèå 3 (признак Даламбера1). Пусть для ряда\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan существует\nпредел lim\nn→Ì\n\f\f\f\nan+1\nan\n\f\f\f=α. Тогда справедливы следующие утверждения:\na) если α<1, то ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan сходится абсолютно;\nb) если α>1, то ряд\nÌ\nP\nn=1\nan расходится;\nc) существуют как абсолютно сходящиеся, так и расходящиеся ряды, для\nкоторых α=1.\n◀a) Если α < 1, то найдется такое число q, что α < q < 1; фиксировав q и\nучитывая свойства предела, найдем номер N ∈N такой, что при любом n> N\nбудет\n\f\f\f\nan+1\nan\n\f\f\f < q. Поскольку конечное число членов не влияет на характер\nсходимости ряда, без ограничения общности будем считать, что\n\f\f\f\nan+1\nan\n\f\f\f < q\nпри любом n∈N.\nПоскольку\n\f\f\f\nan+1\nan\n\f\f\f·\n\f\f\f an\nan−1\n\f\f\f·…·\n\f\f\fa2\na1\n\f\f\f =\n\f\f\f\nan+1\na1\n\f\f\f ,\n\nВопрос студента:\nЧто такое предел функции?\n\nДай подробный и понятный ответ на русском языке.\n</think>\n\nДля понимания понятия действительного числа и его various-side side properties, мы внесли вклад в теоретику действительных чисел. particularly, мы уточнили, что для какого-либо конечного множества X, card X < 2card X, в частности, для любых n ∈ N,card X < 2card X, и это особенно важно при измерении реальных физических величин. Мы также изучали теорему Кантора, которая утверждает, что any closed subset of [0,1] containing all its limit points is either [0,1] itself or a Cantor set. Это важное понятие в теории меры и интеграции.\n\nТакже мы изучали характеристики Cantorova множества, который является тонким и непрерывным множеством, который можно описать с помощью троичной записи чисел, где каждая цифра α_i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, и все числа, которые не имеют 1 в троичной записи, constitute Cantorово множество. Это также связано с тем, что Cantorово множество имеет measure zero и measure one, что делает его неразрывающим.\n\nВажно отметить, что Cantorово множество является тонким и непрерывным множеством, и его характеристики связаны с тем, что его мера равна нулю, а его мера сильной оболочки равна единице. Это означает, что Cantorово множество является непрерывным и тонким, что делает его важным объектом изучения в теории меры и интеграции.\n\nВ общем, Cantorово множество обладает уникальными характеристиками и является важным объектом изучения в теории меры и интеграции, так как его мера равна нулю, а его мера сильной оболочки равна единице.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"\nВведите ваш вопрос по математическому анализу (или 'выход' для завершения):  Непрерывность функции в точке\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\n========================================\n                 ОТВЕТ                  \n========================================\nТы - эксперт по математическому анализу.

Непрерывность функции в точке. Пусть f — вещественнозначная\nфункция, определенная в некоторой окрестности точки a∈R.\nОписательно говоря, функция f непрерывна в точке a, если ее значения\n\nВопрос студента:\nНепрерывность функции в точке\n\nДай подробный и понятный ответ на русском языке.\nХорошо, у меня есть задание о непрерывности функции в точке. Начну с определения и понимания, что означает непрерывность. Некоторые моменты по порядку, возможно, уточню, что мне нужно сделать.\n\nСначала, что такое непрерывность функции в точке. Я вижу, что в учебнике определение written out quite clearly: a function f is continuous at a point a if the limit of f(x) as x approaches a equals f(a). That makes sense. So basically, for any sequence approaching a, the function values should approach f(a). But how does that translate to formal terms?\n\nНаверное, я должен убедиться, что определение严谨o и ясно. Возможно, стоит также упомянуть, что функция может не быть определена в точке a, но непрерывна в этой точке, если предел при x≠a сходится к f(a). Это важно, чтобы не упустить важный момент.\n\nТакже стоит обратить внимание на примеры, чтобы лучше понять, как применять определение. Например, consider f(x) = x². Это непрерывное вEverywhere, так как предел при x→a равен a², и это равно f(a). Но, возможно, стоит упомянуть, как определить предел в practice.\n\nЕсли я вижу, что в определении пределов можно использовать Any neighborhood around a, то я должен быть осторожным в выборе δ для каждого ε. Это может быть сложным, но важно при изображении.\n\nНо как именно показать, что предел f(x) при x→a равен f(a)? Надо убедиться, что для любые δ >0,存在着 neighborhood around a,Such that whenever 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - f(a)| < ε.\n\nТакже, стоит упомянуть, что при определении непрерывности в точке, функция может быть определена или не определена в этой точке. Если функция определена, то предел при x→a должен равен f(a).
